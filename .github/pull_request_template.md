## Checklist

- [ ] `bun run check-types` passes
- [ ] `bun run script/check-deps.ts` clean (dependency direction + source-import scan)
- [ ] `bun run lint:tools` and `bun run lint:tools --self-test` pass (baseline growth = Owner sign-off)
- [ ] Full suite green with an explicit timeout: `bun test --timeout 15000` (a hang is a finding)
- [ ] Tests added/updated for changes — no weakened assertions
- [ ] No `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` added

- [ ] AGENTS.md updated if public API or architecture changed
- [ ] **Independent adversarial review** run by a separate agent/session; verdict linked or pasted in a comment (author's green run alone is not evidence — see AGENTS.md § Execution Discipline)
