 * asserted here as a pure function of a plain record.
 *
 * What has to be pinned is the FALLBACK, not the happy path: an explicit
 * `OPENOMNI_WS_URL` is trivially correct, while the derived loopback URL is a
 * copy of a default that lives in `apps/openomni/src/config.ts` and would
 * otherwise drift silently the day the daemon moves off port 3000.
