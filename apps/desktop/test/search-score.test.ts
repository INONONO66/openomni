 * The scorer is pure and total, so it is asserted directly rather than through

 * report WHICH glyphs matched, and rank matches so a tie inside one attention
 * class breaks the same way every time.
 *
 * What it must NOT do is reorder across classes — that is asserted in
 * search-filter.test.ts, where the sequence actually exists.
