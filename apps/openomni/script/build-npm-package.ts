/**
 * Builds the publishable npm artifact at `apps/openomni/dist-npm`.
 *
 * The staging layout is a contract, not a convenience:
 * - `dist/app/main.js`  — the CLI bundle. Ledger resolves its SQL migration
 *   directory as `join(import.meta.dir, "../../migration")`, so the bundle
 *   MUST sit exactly two levels below the package root, with `migration/`
 *   copied to the root. The pack smoke test boots the bundle against a real
 *   database to keep this coupling honest.
 * - `dist/app/process-entry.js` — the process-transport worker, resolved by
 *   the app as a sibling of the running bundle.
 * - `bin/openomni.js` — node-runnable stub that re-executes under bun.
 * - the generated package.json carries NO dependencies: workspace packages
 *   are folded into the bundles and never exist on the npm registry.
