 * session may hold open per window, how long an approval stays open when
 * nothing names an expiry, and the default run budget. Composition threads
 * `APPROVAL_POLICY` into the session runtime and the executor; the core has
 * no fallback, so a manifest without this provider refuses `seam_missing`
 * at compose (`send-message` requires the seam — the tool door whose sends
 * reach the responders cascades off with the policy, never silently).
