# SLOP: I09 deletion and closure receipts (#948)

#969 cutover, 2026-09-07: request waiting, authenticated consent and outbound delivery now use canonical actions. The new receipt below covers the replacement; historical receipts retain their original source pins. Final HEAD and gate outputs are in the PR and local report.

#971 cutover, 2026-09-08: alarm occurrence identity, deadline and budget admission moved into the ledger's single judgment; evaluators report transport keys only. Receipt below.

#970 cutover, 2026-09-08: interrupted operations settle from classified evidence; attempt evidence, `restore_model_selection` and `restore_context_projection` are recorded actions. No store, table or schema is added or removed; the receipt at the end records what stayed in place.

#972 cutover, 2026-09-08: history and diagnostics are read projections over committed actions. `SessionHandle.history()` pages the append-only tree by revision; `SessionHandle.inspect()` derives redacted causal transitions, policy decisions, requests and compactions. No table, migration, writer or store is added; the receipt at the end names the one moved fold and the census.

Verified on 2026-09-06 against source HEAD `c4fb774869fb060859bbdc2f58ce37ee3a3072c9`, tree `0d6318c742a1ca0eeaa5ddf30003108ba8a53487`; a fresh `git fetch origin main` resolved to the same commit. This docs-only patch preserves that production tree. Final documentation commit/tree and PR URL are recorded in the local `REPORT.md` and PR body.

## G002 authority-cut receipt (#930)

Updated on `kernel/s1-authority-cut-2`, 2026-09-18. These closure rows are new here; no prior G002 in-progress rows existed in this file.

| Surface | Status | Receipt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ledger-core` | ✅ G002 (#930) | Separate event/head store deleted; `decision_fact` records first-writer-wins keyed facts. The action hash chain and `verifyChain` remain the session history integrity owner. |
| `Policy.EffectiveDecision` | ✅ G002 (#930) | Schema/type, re-exports, deleted-surface tests and snapshot entry removed; consumed effect/obligation/decision contracts remain. |
| App `SessionHandleStore.tree()` consumers | ✅ G002 (#930) | Five consumers use exact-key SQL-backed read ports; configuration folding is reused and outbound answers are schema-decoded. `packages/ledger/test/session/read-ports.test.ts` covers each port. Agent tree consumers are unchanged. |

## Effect foundation (#1122) pending-merge rows

| Row | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Composer ownership | ✅ merged `6e1cd457` (PR #1176, #1122) |
| NamedError package error unions | ✅ merged `6e1cd457` (PR #1176, #1122) |
| `throw new Error` ledger write refusals | ✅ merged `6e1cd457` (PR #1176, #1122) |

## W0.5 consumed Layer floor (#1184)

Source inspection on `kernel/1184-consumed-layers-20260924`, 2026-09-24;
this is branch wiring, not merge, CI or global callback-zero evidence.
The four extension points and consumed-service contract are in
[Kernel Contract](kernel-contract.md#extension-points-4-and-bundle-contract).

| Row | Contract | Status and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B6 | No arbitrary code-callback registration; bundles only, through the four extension points. | **CLOSED (#1255, PR #1289).** The code-callback plane is gone: `packages/agent/src/bundle.ts` is a 19-line namespace barrel over `core/compose` and `plugins/alarm` (the validated-Layer / ordered-composition / named-policy-service module it named no longer exists); the `authorizeConfigure` `?? Effect.succeed(true)` fail-open was deleted by W1 (`851a71fc`) and `rg 'Effect\.succeed\(true\)' packages/agent/src` → 0; `approvalBindings` → 0 files. The only extension road is data: `Capability.define` / `Bundle.define` / `Manifest.define` (`packages/agent/src/core/capability.ts`) declare kinds, points, handlers, purposes, tools and rows, and `compose(manifest)` (`core/compose.ts`) resolves every handler name against the declarations, rejecting `unknown_handler` / `unknown_point` inside the closed six-code set; the handler table is built once at compose (`HandlerTable`, no registration API) and provided as the `GenerationHandlers` tag. Census on the PR head: `rg 'registerHandler|registerPlugin|addHook\(|onEvent\(' packages/agent/src` → 0; `rg 'BundlesLive|BundleDefinitions|bundlePolicyTag|NamedPolicyRegistry' packages apps` → 0; `rg --files apps/openomni/src | rg 'tools/monitor\.ts|composition/monitor-ports\.ts'` → empty. |

Observation subscribers, tool bodies, named pure transformer implementations
and ordinary Effect callbacks are allowed implementations, not an arbitrary
authority-registration API. No concrete hooks/MCP/LSP bundle or W3 membership
mount/unmount API is delivered by this floor. `Snapshot.bundles` records
selection; it does not make volatile scopes durable or establish full G1.
(#1256 delivers the first concrete hooks bundle through that data road:
`apps/openomni/src/bundles/hooks-json` compiles the Owner's hooks file into
gate rows over the removable `plugins/hook` capability's `hook/process`
handler — still declarations plus named handlers, no registration API.)

## Receipt location and scope

This is the tracked successor for the #948 rows formerly recorded in `.omo/reports/operation-architecture-20260902/SLOP.md`. PRs #981/#982 removed tracked agent artifacts; no `.omo/` file is recreated. Historical ledger/design text remains in git history, not an active contract. This file synchronizes the I09 rows and #811 disposition only; it does not mark unrelated historical SLOP rows closed.

The Owner-approved #945/#948 amendment overrides stale campaign labels and E4 parking. Deletion evidence, remaining quality acceptance, and the parked #950 successor are separate. This is not a zero-failure/final-convergence receipt and does not close #945 or the full #948 acceptance.

## Historical #947 stage-1 alarm contribution (unmerged)

| Row | Receipt |
| --- | --- |
| B4 | ✅ Historical closure receipt updated by W5.2 #1197: the separate lease/alarm/inbox planes, `alarm-worker.ts`, and `executor-retry-alarm.ts` are deleted; request deadlines and monitor occurrences now use chain-guarded `DeliverAt` messages consumed by the session entity. Plan §5(a) deletion grep is zero, and the parent-measured crash matrix retains all 27 faults. |
| E8 | Additive `monitor` registration and strict create/rearm/cancel schema implemented; no claim about unrelated vocabulary. |
| Alarm quality | Focused 30 tests pass, including real PTY exit/dedupe, exact timeout, budget pause/rearm, path create/modify/cancel, atomic rollback, SQLite reopen, and hibernation/live-wait. |
| Path readiness correction | The same path source reconciles stat identity on the app scan; unchanged scans append nothing. The test subscribes before mutation and drives reconciliation before native callbacks can run. The previous create timeout is retained in local history, not hidden by sleeps or retries. |
| Full verification | On rebased production checkpoint `6a912340`: build, workspace/script types, dependency/cycle checks, lint, tool lint, formatter-disabled Ultracite and dead-export gates exit 0. `bun test --timeout 15000` passes 3377 tests across 359 files in one run, zero failures. |
| Coverage | All 11 coverage-producing lanes pass, then the unchanged ratchet passes: app 96.83%, agent 97.73%, ledger 99.34%; no floors lowered. |
| Real surface and mutation | WebSocket -> monitor -> real path/create -> atomic inbox -> hibernated session wake passes (two model calls, revision 59). PTY/FIFO app regression passes; removing app async-context binding fails with the expired tool-wave AbortError. |
| Tool schema | Owner-approved nested `operation` discriminates create/rearm/cancel; create nests `source`, controls require `alarmId`. `bun run lint:tools` passes under the existing field cap, with no exemption or floor reduction. |
| Lifecycle campaign | No #969-#973 transition/deletion/test receipt is consumed by stage 1. |

R1 correction evidence (after main `678d357e` merge): production checkpoint
`21675e12` passes all gates, including tool-lint self-test; 3435 tests pass in
one full-suite run, zero failures. Ten current coverage lanes and the unchanged
ratchet pass (app 97.08%, ledger 99.34%, agent 97.73%). The removed placement
lane is main's deletion, not a floor change introduced by this PR.

| Finding | Failing-first proof -> correction |
| --- | --- |
| R1 callback timeout | Three PTY line/exit/native-path tests fail before the callback deadline check; all pass with timeout precedence. No scan is triggered by those tests. |
| R2 descendants | Five real child-of-child HUP-ignoring process probes fail before group cleanup. Cancel/timeout/pause/exit/shutdown/rearm now close exact death-witness sockets and leave no live probed process. |
| R3 migration guard | Seventeen invalid historical specs formerly upgraded; each now refuses with the alarm id and byte-identical old database. Complete command/path upgrades still pass. |
| R4 reconciliation oracle | Removing source observation now fails on the synchronous inbox count before any yield; restored implementation passes. |
| R5 inferred types | Compiler test fails on untyped JSON results/catch bindings; corrected boundary files report zero. Its planted mutant still fails discrimination. No cast, suppression, exemption or baseline growth was added. |

Decisions and operator contracts: [alarm-monitor-stage-1.md](alarm-monitor-stage-1.md).

## A rows: already-absent production domains

| Rows | Target | Classification at source HEAD | Merged deletion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| A13 | `WorkItem`/task Attempt domain, completion, stores, schemas and tools | ALREADY-ABSENT under the exact #940 grep. Semantic archival survivors below are not hidden. Provider attempt children remain live. | #940, PR #960, `6c5d65d6`; #967 correction PR #977, `eec7f7fc` |

| A4, A16 | Conversation/lease/engagement stores/schemas and converse/lease tools | ALREADY-ABSENT; session fencing, gateway send, grants, egress budgets and waiting retained at that historical source; replaced by original-action requests in #969 | #943, PR #961, `23ad4f6b` |

### #944 expanded G-row receipt

These rows came from #944's issue comment. Partial completion is reported rather than inferred from its CLOSED label.

| Rows | Scoped check/evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G-P01/P02/P03/P04/P05/P08 | `rg -n '(StreamRegistry\|RouteDecided\|extractText\|ExecutionUsage\|ModelStatus\|GovernorIncident)'` using alternation as in the command below, scoped to former owners | Zero hits; aliases/helpers/events removed |
| G-L1 | Installation store/adapter symbol and deleted-path checks below | Zero hits |
| G-L4 | `cron_job` excluded from runtime reset list; only immutable migration names remain in the migration runner | Fresh schema contains no cron/installation/transcript tables; migration 0032 owns guarded removal |
| G-CH1 | Four obsolete dispatch failure-code spellings, checked with other app/ledger symbols below | Zero hits |
| G-CH4 | `rg -n '"bridge"' packages/channels/src/provider/contract.ts` | Zero hits |
| G-CH7 | Read all four provider `surface.ts` handler use sites | Handler required at start; delivery uses the captured handler directly, no second missing-handler fallback. Discord/Slack retain start guards; GitHub/Telegram use `requireHandler`. |
| G-CH8 | `rg -n 'export.*(IngestMode\|ProviderCapabilities\|ProviderRuntime\|PublishPort\|Adapter\|normalize)'` with alternation, scoped to `packages/channels/src/index.ts` | Zero hits; root now exports the live provider registry/router surface. `ProviderRuntime` inside its defining module is not a stale root export. |
| G-CH9 | `rg -n 'export (interface\|type) (GatewayCallbacks\|SocketCallbacks\|PollerCallbacks)' packages/channels/src` | Zero hits; closed as already true at HEAD (2026-09-25, `d5b48a1b` #1190, no code change). All three are module-private: `GatewayCallbacks` (`discord/gateway.ts:23`), `SocketCallbacks` (`slack/socket.ts:15`), `PollerCallbacks` (`telegram/poller.ts:9`). The earlier "remain exported" finding is stale. |
| G-H1 | `rg -n 'FiberSnapshot\|snapshot\(\|pending'` with alternation in `apps/openomni/src/composition/composer.ts` | Zero hits; executable `ctx.effect` teardown registration survives, not the removed diagnostic snapshot. |
| G-H5 | Deleted-path census includes `apps/openomni/src/provisioning/init.ts` | Zero paths; app/CLI no longer expose the one-shot import. |

Executable scoped commands (all zero hits/exit 1):

```bash
rg -n '(StreamRegistry|RouteDecided|extractText|ExecutionUsage|ModelStatus|GovernorIncident)' packages/protocol/src/ledger packages/protocol/src/ingress packages/protocol/src/token packages/protocol/src/model packages/protocol/src/event/operational.ts packages/llm/src/model -g '*.ts'
rg -n '(AppConnectorInstallationStore|sqlite-app-connector-installation-adapter|FiberSnapshot|initializeProvisioning|dispatch_runtime_missing|dispatch_route_invalid|dispatch_failed|dispatch_output_unsupported)' apps/openomni/src packages/ledger/src packages/channels/src -g '*.ts' -g '!*.test.ts'
rg -n 'export.*(IngestMode|ProviderCapabilities|ProviderRuntime|PublishPort|Adapter|normalize)' packages/channels/src/index.ts
rg -n '"bridge"' packages/channels/src/provider/contract.ts
rg -n 'FiberSnapshot|snapshot\(|pending' apps/openomni/src/composition/composer.ts
```

G-CH9 nonzero receipt: `rg -n 'GatewayCallbacks|SocketCallbacks|PollerCallbacks' packages apps -g '*.ts' -g '!*.test.ts' -g '!**/test/**' -g '!**/dist/**'` returns six lines (three declarations, three same-file constructor uses). This is a real remaining un-export, not a new product consumer.

## #967 semantic and data-retention receipt

The case-variant census is intentionally broader than #940:

```bash
rg -n -i '(work[_-]?item|complete_work|work_items)' apps packages script -g '*.ts' -g '!*.test.ts' -g '!**/test/**' -g '!**/fixtures/**' -g '!**/dist/**'
```

It returns **two production-source hits**, not zero:

- `packages/ledger/src/storage/u967-projection.ts:9`: offline historical projection schema accepts the retired owner spelling to validate archival eligibility. `initializeSqliteDatabase` / archive verification -> `inspect967Projections` -> `HistoricalProjection` checks old rows; that historical public owner schema was subsequently removed by #969; frozen formats now live in `storage/historical-request-format.ts`.
- `script/generate-ledger-archive-manifest.ts:151`: approved archive disposition deletes eligible retired-owner rows with revision and owner predicates. CLI -> locked receipt verification -> guarded migration preparation -> this delete. No live owner creation or fallback reader is reintroduced.

The semantic census must keep these archival-only uses visible. They are not relabeled grep-zero, and no schema/history is destroyed to satisfy a lexical check. A direct schema probe rejects `workItem` and accepts `session`. Generic model attempt children are distinct and remain live.

`rg -n '\bonFact\b|Session\.(create|list|get|remove|delete|sweep|addMessage)|sweepExpiredSessions|sessionTtl' apps packages script -g '*.ts' -g '!*.test.ts' -g '!**/test/**' -g '!**/dist/**'` is zero. The word-boundary avoids false hits in unrelated desktop `SessionFacts` types. WebSocket source has no query-token reader; canonical subprotocol authentication is the only token path (#974).

A direct fresh `initializeSqliteDatabase` probe found none of `work_item`, `artifact`, `conversation`, `lease`, `engagement`, `transcript_fact`, `cron_job`, `app_connector_installation`, `bus_event`. `message`, `part`, and `wait` remain. The full test run also executed fresh/upgraded archive, guarded refusal, and boot preservation scenarios; its unrelated failures below prevent a whole-suite green claim. Historical migration files are unchanged.

## E rows and #948 acceptance limits

| Row/acceptance | Status at this source |
| --- | --- |
| E3 | OPEN #945: production/test clone findings are measured by jscpd in the scheduled Quality Audit (#1116) and filed as `quality:` issues; clone-zero remains final convergence. Unchanged at W5.3 #1113 (PR #1240): clones 280 → 280 (`.omo/reports/kernel-campaign-w53/B-verify.md`). |
| E4 | Written-keyword half closed W5.3 #1113 (PR #1240, ⏳ pending merge) — the AST gate `script/check-written-types.ts` counts written `any`/`unknown` type keywords with no baseline (only `*.test.ts(x)` excluded) and blocks above 0; the repository census went 68 → 0 (`.omo/reports/kernel-campaign-w53/A3.md`). The quality-audit `types` count (2123 at W5.3 HEAD, down from 2779) is the transitive inferred-type census at owned reference sites, not written keywords; it remains scheduled-audit debt, never blocking. |
| E5 | Superseded 2026-09-20 (#1116, PR #1117 `c9c53af0`): the per-PR ratchet, census and baselines were deleted. The PR gate is Patch Coverage on changed lines; absolute type/complexity/clone/coverage debt is measured by the scheduled Quality Audit and recorded as issues, never blocking. Full mutation is the sharded `quality-mutation.yml` campaign (#1049); W5.3 #1113 (PR #1240) fixed its baseline-compiler rejection (root-file candidate ownership, pilot receipts under `.omo/reports/kernel-campaign-w53/A5-pilot*/`) and added cyclomatic/Halstead/CRAP function metrics to the scheduled audit — the full campaign stays scheduled. Final all-dimension zero belongs to #973. |
| E7 | OPEN: prompt builder has no memory parameter and presets have no deleted tool instruction, but `apps/openomni/test/prompt.test.ts:27-29` still pins prose/code-mode phrases. Structural assembly assertions coexist with those pins. No tests were added or modified in this docs-only PR. | ✅ merged `75d28562` (PR #1193, W3 #1111, 2026-09-26) |
| Synchronous completion signal | Locally invoked the real builder for Resident/Worker, split the returned machine-consumed prompt into blocks, asserted zero removed sentinels: Resident 3 blocks, Worker 2. No sleep/poll. Catalog contained `approval`, `await_delegation`, `cancel_delegation`, `delegate`, `llm`, `provision`, `run_code`; zero removed tool names. |
| Prompt/signature mutation | Existing tests do not supply the full requested negative signature/sentinel mutation contract; no claim that restoring an unused parameter must fail them. This acceptance remains open rather than adding a prose test or claiming an unrun mutant. |
| Generated-doc mutation | Temporarily added `apps/openomni` to generated `ui` consumers. `bun run lint:docs` exited 1 with `AGENTS.md dependency topology is stale`. Regenerated via `script/generate-agents-deps.ts`; restored check exited 0. Generated block is unchanged from the correct source topology. |

The narrower existing gates are the empty-baseline Knip ratchet, protocol start/terminal pairing, and enumerated ledger-producer drift. They are not #945's complete publisher/export/store census. Expanded #945 requirements additionally include coverage100%, production/test clones0, cyclomatic<22, cognitive<22, Halstead difficulty<80, CRAP<25 and surviving mutants0 with frozen tools, inventories, settings and mutation operators. Full mutation remains scheduled/final-convergence work, not silently waived.

## #973 lifecycle conformance receipt (2026-09-08)

| Row | Disposition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Harness | `runLifecycleTrace` in `packages/agent/test/session-lifecycle-conformance.test.ts` drives the real store, controller, executor, request port, outbound path and alarm rows; six section 6.7 registrations exist and pass. | `bun test packages/agent/test/session-lifecycle-conformance.test.ts` -> 6 pass |
| Deletion matrix | No production writer moved, no fixture deleted, no compat alias or dual path introduced; the contract's #973 rows cite HEAD symbols. | `docs/session-lifecycle-contract.md` #973 rows |
| Replay | Every trace reopens its SQLite image; fold equals the last prefix with dispatched bodies, tool observations and commits `[]`. | `replayEffectFree` in the harness |
| Mutation probes | Deadline `>=`->`>`, boot sweep ignoring open-turn-only sessions, interrupt sealing before waves settle, dropped `request.sessionId` routing check: each fails the conformance file. Dropped `request.requestId` routing check and dropped `previouslySeen` dedupe are unreachable through the store (requests are looked up by their own id; a replayed input id with another principal is a digest conflict) and are killed by `session-request.test.ts` (`refuses an answer addressed to another request before any record`, `counts distinct responders, not repeated replies, for all and quorum`). | `bun test packages/agent` -> 1 fail per mutant, 456 pass restored |
| #945 all-dimension zero | Not closed here. W5.3 #1113 (PR #1240, ⏳ pending merge) zeroed written `any`/`unknown` keywords (blocking gate at 0) and passed the root suite locally 4635/0 (`.omo/reports/kernel-campaign-w53/B-verify.md`), but absolute coverage/CRAP/mutation stay with the scheduled audit and `quality-mutation.yml`; final all-dimension zero remains open. | E5 row above |
| Contract checker | The manual receipt checker in the contract aborts on a pre-existing #969 row citing the deleted `packages/channels/src/router/wait/lifecycle.ts`; #973's eight rows validate individually. | pre-existing on main |

## Local verification

Darwin arm64; Bun `1.4.1` (`4661e494f`), TypeScript `5.9.2`, Knip `6.31.0`, Ultracite `7.8.3`, Biome `2.4.16`. Frozen-lockfile installation completed. No production/test/lockfile edits.

| Command | Exit / result |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run build` | 0; Turbo reported 6 successful tasks, cache restored |
| `bunx turbo run check-types` | 0; 16 successful tasks |
| `bunx tsc -p script/tsconfig.json` | 0 after workspace build |

| Markdown LSP diagnostics | Unavailable: no `.md` language server configured; generated-doc gate and `git diff --check` used instead |

Initial `lint:tools` and script tsc attempts before build could not resolve package `dist` exports. The required workspace build supplied those artifacts; post-build commands passed. This was prerequisite setup, not a source fix or suppressed error.

Full-suite failure output (unchanged code; not retried to obtain green):

```text
(fail) discord gateway state machine (#520) > identifies with the real token and survives many heartbeat intervals when acked
error: WebSocket closed before ready: 1002
reason: Expected 101 status code
  packages/channels/src/provider/discord/gateway.ts:138

(fail) 967 WAL rollback crash and resumability > a contender triggered by the exact in-transaction lock signal cannot write

  packages/channels/test/discord-gateway.test.ts:60

# Unhandled error between tests
error: timed out waiting for gateway signal
  packages/channels/test/discord-gateway.test.ts:60
```

The second failure's stack is the earlier gateway fixture's pending signal, not evidence that the archive lock admitted a contender. The same output records the contender's `SQLITE_BUSY`. An expected failing cleanup-oracle subprocess also prints a failure but is not one of the final two suite failures. Related prompt, boot catalog, deleted-surface Knip discrimination, event-pairing, ledger producer drift, and model/cell truncation assertions passed within this run. Existing failures remain visible; no test was skipped/deleted and no baseline grew.

## F. #811 park disposition

GitHub changes executed and re-read with `gh` on 2026-09-06:

- #811 remains CLOSED; its body now leads with supersession by #950 and links #948. Historical scope is explicitly historical.
- #950 remains OPEN with `icebox`, `architecture`, `improvement`; its body explicitly places it outside #930 and cross-links #811/#948. No duplicate successor was filed.
- Scope stays exactly #950's machine-offer isolation capability/fail-closed execution and gateway egress secret gate, including its existing profile/blocklist/scanner acceptance. No implementation or profile/scanner design is absorbed into I08.
- Re-triage remains closure of #938/#939 (I08) and #946 (I06); all three are OPEN at verification. This is a parking receipt, not a hardening delivery claim.

## #949 stage 1 receipt (2026-09-06)

Based on `f9c02a66` including the real machine consumer surface from #991.
This receipt does not seal the final catalog or duplicate #946/#947 work.

| Row | Stage-one disposition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B15, G-AG3 | CLOSED: target-selection workspace, topology/dependency/Knip/CI/coverage rows and executor eligibility wrapper deleted. Model selection moved to llm; tool.pre remains call-time authority. | `script/tool-target-deletion.test.ts`; model fallback and tool-admission tests |
| G-H7 | CLOSED: credential decryption and bounce-key rotation share one store read per credential per reconciliation. | provisioning test observes one actual SecretStore.get call |
| G-H9 | CLOSED: orphan model-resolution comment removed from llm tool module. | source diff; no prose test |
| E8 / A15 truncation sub-condition | CLOSED after R1 review correction: central 32,000-code-unit model cap includes literal truncated and exact dropped/original UTF-8 byte counts, retaining a valid Unicode boundary; cell output remains full and no spill port is required. | `packages/agent/test/tool-dispatcher.test.ts` ASCII/multibyte exact receipts; local/real-daemon large-file and Unicode tests |
| G-H8 | OPEN stage 2: schema census still constructs legacy approval/delegation factories using the catalog Proxy. Removing those dependencies would overlap protected #946 files. | `apps/openomni/src/tools/core/catalog.ts` |
| A11, A12, B12, B17, B18, E6, E8 catalog seal | Not closed by stage 1. New path tools consume the existing package-owned dispatcher; final naming/layout and exact catalog belong to stage 2. | #949 stage boundary |

`apps/openomni/test/locus-routing.test.ts` exercises five filesystem verbs and
bash both locally and through a real attached Unix-socket daemon, binary reads,
unique-match edit refusals, large raw cell values, recursive literal search and
daemon capability refusal. Completion is promise settlement, with no sleep or
polling. The explicit stage-one naming is retained rather than implementing the
later naming amendment in parallel with the messaging worker.

## #949 stage 2 receipt (2026-09-07)

Stage 2 seals the catalog on the KERNEL §3.5 names. Greps below are against the
merge HEAD of the stage-2 PR, production `.ts` only (tests, `dist/` excluded).

| Row | Stage-two disposition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B17 | CLOSED: the `approval` tool ({request,decide,contact_promote,endpoint_merge}) and its hourly pending cap are deleted. `contact_promote`/`contact_merge` are `provision` ops whose Owner consent is a `require_approval` policy row (`PROVISION_POLICY_ROWS`) resolved by the #969 request path; the policy `Match` gained an inner `operation` field to scope a row to one op. No model-callable `decide` exists. | `apps/openomni/src/tools/provision.ts`, `apps/openomni/src/tools/core/contact-mutations.ts`, `apps/openomni/test/provision-consent.test.ts` (forged `request`/`decide`/`approvalId` ops are `invalid_input`; consent flows through the kernel request and re-admits the exact captured invocation) |
| B18 | CLOSED: flat `apps/openomni/src/tools/<tool_name>.ts` plus `locus.ts` and `core/`; no `tools/{query,mutation,authority,execution}` or target-axis directories. `category` remains a `defineTool` field only. | `ls apps/openomni/src/tools` |
| E8 / E9 | CLOSED: model door == `{read,write,edit,ls,find,grep,bash,eval,monitor,send_message,provision}`, cell-only `completion`; snake_case; one discriminator `op` under `operation` for eval/monitor/provision; `contact` is the single model noun (`Actor` stays protocol-internal); `command` not `cmd`; `completion({prompt, model?, system?, schema?})` with `parallel()` for batching. Stage 3 residue closed: codemode machine-handle methods are the tool names (`read/write/ls/bash/eval`; the old `list/stat/shell/run` names are grep-zero), `eval.op = run | peek | stop` over a per-tenant background cell registry (peek returns the streamed partial output of a running cell; stop settles it as `cancelled` and never re-runs it), and the tool file name is the tool name in kebab-case (`send-message.ts`, pinned by the `[tool-file-name]` lint). | `apps/openomni/src/tools/core/catalog.ts`, `catalog.test.ts` (literal pin, op sets, completion fields, retired-name refusal), `script/lint-tools.ts` (snake_case + file-name ratchets), `script/conformance/tool-schema-snapshot.json` (12 specs), `packages/codemode/test/consumer.test.ts` (peek/stop behavior), `apps/openomni/test/code-mode-e2e.test.ts` (eval run/peek/stop and completion options through the model door) |
| G-H8 | CLOSED: the nested Proxy fake port is gone; `createTools` constructs every tool regardless of wired ports and a tool whose port is absent refuses at execution (`ToolRefused`). | `apps/openomni/src/tools/core/catalog.ts` |
| A11, A12, B12, E6 | Reconfirmed zero: no `fs_read/fs_list/fs_stat/machines`, `delegate*`, `work_items`, `converse`, `memory`, `artifacts`, `run_code`, `llm`/`llm_batched`, `list`/`search`, or `sendMessage` tool definitions in production. | `rg -n 'name: "(fs_read\|fs_list\|fs_stat\|machines\|delegate\|await_delegation\|cancel_delegation\|work_items\|converse\|memory\|artifacts\|approval\|run_code\|llm\|llm_batched\|list\|search\|sendMessage)"' apps packages -g '*.ts' -g '!*.test.ts' -g '!dist/**'` → 0 |

## #938 follow-up

- **R3-3 (parked):** add a platform-specific `fchdir`/descriptor-backed cwd
  helper for exec so shell startup can inherit the pinned export directory.
  Current contract deliberately accepts the bounded pathname check/spawn TOCTOU.

## #946 stage-2 cutover receipts (historical; #969 supersedes lifecycle ownership)

Rebased onto `f9c02a66` (#991). This PR closes the implementation rows below; final gate receipts are in its PR body. Historical sections above are not rewritten as current gate evidence.

| Rows | Closed by this cutover |
| --- | --- |
| A3, C4 | Retired continuation/settlement authority removed; child terminal mail crosses compiled message policy and the atomic session writer. |
| A10 | Legacy delegation/await/cancel tools and their catalog entries removed; sendMessage returns a handle without joining. |
| A17 | Separate delegation/worker-run adapters and exports removed; guarded migration 0035 drops only empty retired tables. |
| B3, B10 | One two-argument ingest and injected inbox commit; facts-only drivers, no return-value writeback or trigger-rule admission. |
| B4 | Message deadlines persist as alarm rows with answer/timeout CAS; startup owner tested before/at deadline and across restart. Live scheduling remains #947. |
| B7 | Ledger stores channel-grant facts; channels alone resolves treatment. |
| C5, C8 | No retired task eligibility or worker-run correlation; authenticated session/action/message identities are used. |
| D3 | Indexed durable live reply-grant projection replaces full route-history boot replay. |

Retained ownership, not a hidden alternate path:

- #947 still owns continuous live due-dispatch and monitoring. The former message-specific startup expiry path is replaced in #969; its historical receipt does not prove the new path.


Source and test runtime-symbol census (each prints zero matches and exits 1):

```bash
rg -n 'DelegationKernel|Delegation\.|delegation\.settled|/delegation/|DELEGATE_TOOL_NAME|await_delegation|cancel_delegation|delegation_await|delegation_cancel|create(Await|Cancel)DelegationTool' apps/openomni/{src,test} packages/{agent,channels,ledger,protocol}/{src,test} -g '*.ts'
rg -n 'deliverWake|settleFromReply|awaitDelegation|processWorkerRun|registerDelegationProcessEntry|registerDelegationChannelDriver|nextTimerDelay|respondUnderTyping|GitHubNormalizer|TriggerRule|WorkerRunStateStore|workerRunId|worker_run_state' apps/openomni/{src,test} packages/{agent,channels,ledger,protocol}/{src,test} -g '*.ts'
```

The immutable migration manifest still names historical migration 0023. The guarded SQL migrations and offline archive checks intentionally retain historical table names; they are not live adapters or producers. No coverage floor is lowered.

## #969 action waiting, delivery and retained history

| Scope | Cutover disposition | Acceptance surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waiting/approval authority | Independent protocol folds, stores, adapters, tables and writers removed; one original-action CAS | Kernel request race tests; real Owner socket/SIGKILL/restart test |
| Protected mutations | Captured input/effect/catalog/domain binding; global pending-count CAS; at-most-once application claim | Wrong principal/hash/domain tests; body-entry domain race |
| Child delivery | Terminal plus source obligation commit together; receiving inbox is idempotent and source acknowledgement requires its receipt | Native/process app tests; lost-ack restart; dropped-receiving-consumer mutant |
| Physical channels | Grant/budget/idempotency and drivers retained; receipt identity never upgrades unknown/rejected to accepted | Real Telegram harness; quorum/all/chain and receipt tests |
| Historical data | Forward migration refuses unresolved state and retains terminal rows in immutable archives | Fresh/0035 upgrades, archival equality, rollback and Bun 1.3.6 tests |


`script/request-authority-census.ts` scans production, fixtures, and public schemas, including local untracked files, using Linux-compatible git grep. It rejects retired public APIs, live-table SQL, old correlation fields/events, and legacy module paths. Exact archival SQL allowances do not exempt an entire file: adding a store/sub-adapter to an archival fixture or a write to the read-only preflight still fails. One exact historical event remains in the hash-chain adoption fixture. Source comments and immutable migration comments are not executable authority. Dynamic SQL/name construction and semantically renamed engines remain outside this lexical/AST guard.

The old producer entries and allowed perimeter store import are removed. Protocol/tool snapshots are generated from the current public barrel and catalog: SessionTransition maps to existing Session/Action vocabulary, and protected mutation no longer accepts model-minted approval decisions. The channels manifest allows agent for real-kernel tests only, not production source.

Migration 0038 retains terminal legacy row bytes in immutable archive_969_wait/archive_969_approval tables; it does not erase action history or rewrite historical migrations. Unresolved or invalid old rows refuse before mutation. The #967 archive command remains explicitly confirmed and pinned separately. Unresolved old message alarms and native child execution also refuse. The replacement is covered by request/outbound race, restart and actual receiving-executor tests; final command receipts remain attached to the PR. Message/part retention, continuous scheduling (#947), and the broader #945/#948 quality campaign remain outside this cutover.

## #971 monitor occurrences and evaluator recovery

| Scope | Cutover disposition | Acceptance surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity split | Alarm id = control identity/inbox origin; persisted `fence` = evaluator authority; occurrence = `Alarm.occurrenceId(alarmId, epoch, sourceKey)` as the `alarm.fired`/`alarm.paused` action id. No redundant occurrence table or id column. | `monitor-occurrence.test.ts` two matches -> two action ids; same key redelivered -> undefined, revision unchanged |
| Admission owner | `alarmOccurrence` in `packages/ledger/src/storage/l0-action-builders.ts` is the only judgment (fence, due, dedupe, deadline, budget), shared by SQLite and the memory double; `Alarm.Fire` lost `actionId`, `inboxId`, `limit` | `alarm.test.ts` parity, `alarm-control.test.ts` budget-of-one pause, `monitor-occurrence.test.ts` late match settles as timeout |
| Takeover vs rearm | `acquire` keeps epoch/count/digest; `rearm` resets them; both advance the fence before physical cleanup | `monitor-occurrence.test.ts` poll A -> takeover -> A suppressed, B delivers, old fence zero, rearm re-admits A; `alarm-boot-durability.test.ts` real PTY restart gap |
| Budget | N notifications then one `alarm.paused` prompt on N+1; N+2 and every stale contender commit zero; cancel of paused refuses later fires | `monitor-occurrence.test.ts`, `monitor-budget.test.ts` |
| Recovery limits | Live streams restart from now; timed watches settle `restart`; cursor backends not added; band retains OS handles only | `alarm-worker-boundaries.test.ts`, `monitor-process-group.test.ts`, `monitor-app.test.ts` hibernation wake |
| Deletion | Worker-side `expired` computation, caller-minted random action/inbox ids and caller-supplied `limit` removed with their schema fields in the same PR; `schema-snapshot.json` regenerated for `Alarm.Fire` | `git grep -n -e "randomUUID" -e "limit:" -e "expired" apps/openomni/src/composition/alarm-worker.ts` -> zero |

## #970 durable recovery and typed restoration

| Scope | Cutover disposition | Acceptance surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recovery authority | One owner: formerly `packages/agent/src/executor-recovery.ts` (since #1247 `packages/agent/src/kernel/gate/decide.ts`); classification pinned on intents; post-body exceptions and crash-open intents settle failed/outcome_unknown from evidence, refused commits stay pending | `packages/agent/test/executor-recovery.test.ts` per site and per kind; turn dispatcher recovery runs no tool |
| Retry owners | Provider retry stays with `createAttemptRunner`; no second retry loop introduced; channel socket backoff (transport) and summarizer shrink loop (wraps recorded llm) audited as non-owners | `core/execution/llm-attempts.test.ts` pins ordinal/cap/reason and settled evidence |
| Attempt evidence | Usage, visible-output boundary, finish reason and `Auth.reference` (type + 16-hex digest) recorded; the credential itself is never written | `packages/llm/test/run-outcome.test.ts`, `packages/llm/test/auth/storage.test.ts` |
| Model restoration | Turn-boundary `restore_model_selection` from the durable last attempt; refusal keeps the fallback pinned | `core/model-restore.test.ts`, `model-selection.test.ts`, two-turn `session-chat-runner.test.ts` (test path unchanged; the former `session-chat-runner.ts` source is `packages/agent/src/session/run.ts` since #1247) |
| Context restoration | `restore_context_projection` appends under the compaction parent with the lease held; original compaction facts intact; unknown/unexecuted compaction refused before recording | `session-context-restore.test.ts` |
| Deletion | Nothing deleted: no duplicate retry owner or process-local recovery authority remained at post-#969 main beyond the implicit chain reset in `run.ts`, which the recorded restoration replaces | `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD`: 25 files, no migration, no schema |

The contract's `move` rows for `session-admission.ts`/`session-turn.ts` into `session-lifecycle/*.ts` were not executed then; the symbols stayed in `session-admission.ts`/`session-turn.ts` until #1247 moved them to `packages/agent/src/session/mailbox.ts` and `packages/agent/src/session/run.ts`. Gate outputs and the final HEAD are in the PR body.

## #972 action-based history and diagnostic projections

| Scope | Cutover disposition | Acceptance surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authoritative history read | `SessionHandleStore.historyPage` reads the session row revision and `actions.range(sessionId, afterRevision, limit)` in one transaction; `nextRevision` continues an incomplete page and is null at the head. `watch()` gaps are hints: the caller re-reads from `gap.from`; no event is synthesized | `packages/ledger/test/session/kernel.test.ts` dropped-notification resync; `packages/ledger/test/storage/adapter-contracts.test.ts` range contract on both adapters |
| Canonical context fold | `foldSessionHistory` in `packages/agent/src/session-lifecycle/history.ts` (moved from `session-history.ts`, which is deleted). Model context carries delivered prompts, assistant snapshots, positional tool settlements and compaction projections only | `packages/agent/test/session-history.test.ts` (kept at its contract path), `session-context-restore.test.ts` |
| Diagnostic projection | `inspectActions`/`inspectSession` in `packages/agent/src/session-lifecycle/inspect.ts` (since #1247 `packages/agent/src/inspect/index.ts`) derive one `SessionHistory.Transition` per action with `cause` (`action`/`inbox`/`alarm`/`root`), turn/call/request identity, outcome and a canonical digest; `outcome_unknown` is its own outcome; a pre denial is the refused call's only terminal record (`blocked_pre` on the decision). Payloads are never copied, so credentials in tool input do not appear | `packages/agent/test/session-inspection.test.ts`: child session, retried model call, tool refusal, approval, `outcome_unknown` effect, monitor wake and compaction; every cause resolves to a committed action, inbox row or alarm |
| Policy inspection | `inspectPolicy(decisions, {generation, ruleId, verdict})` over the recorded `policy.decision` actions; reason and inputHash are the recorded ones | same suite, `deny`/`require_approval` rows by rule and verdict |
| Cross-session traversal | `inspect({depth})` follows only `parentId` (commissioned children). Outbound destinations appear as `peerSessionId` and are not read | same suite: parent -> child, depth 0 yields none |
| Compaction evidence | Existing `compaction` result (`summary`, `firstKeptEntryId`, `discarded{first,last,count,sha256}`, revert recipe) is surfaced as `SessionHistory.Compaction` with `restoredBy`; original facts untouched | same suite; `session-context-restore.test.ts` |
| Pure replay | Inspection and paging run no body and append nothing; a rebuilt page sequence equals the tree, and its fold equals the canonical fold | same suite: body counter and tree equality before/after |
| Transcript / fact taps | `Transcript.fold` stays: it is the ephemeral provider-stream assembler in `packages/llm/src/processor`. `onFact` remains grep-zero (see #944 grep above). OTel/log ids are derived from turn/session identity in `executor-record.ts` (since #1247 `packages/agent/src/kernel/gate/decide.ts`); no durable trace grammar | `rg -n '\bonFact\b' apps packages -g '*.ts'` = 0 |
| Deletion | `packages/agent/src/session-history.ts` removed with its five importers rewired in the same commit; no schema, table or migration touched (`message`/`part` bytes refused per contract) | `rg -n "session-history\"|\bsessionHistory\b" apps packages -g '*.ts'` = 0 (the unrelated ledger benchmark seeder of the same name became `seedTurnHistory`) |

`LedgerAction.Kind` is unchanged: no new action kind was needed, so no forward CHECK migration ships. The #971 occurrence kinds will project through the generic `record` phase when they land.

## #945 absolute census receipt (2026-09-19, main `f5ea0e32`)

The #945 amendment demands literal zero on every gate. The ratchet on main is green because it forbids growth against the admitted baseline, not because the baseline is empty. This section records the absolute distance so no closure claim can rest on a green ratchet alone.

Measurement (fragments under `script/conformance/quality-baseline-lcov-bound/` at `f5ea0e32`; each row is one measured finding, `count` its multiplicity):

| gate | rows | count | files |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| coverage (unexecuted lines) | 45,981 | 54,150 | 864 |
| type (any/unknown census) | 12,410 | 43,144 | 683 |
| crap | 1,268 | 1,270 | 393 |
| testClones | 375 | 558 | 162 |
| export | 334 | 334 | 173 |
| productionClones | 70 | 74 | 38 |
| publisher | 39 | 39 | 12 |
| cyclomatic | 16 | 16 | 14 |
| cognitive | 11 | 11 | 11 |
| store | 5 | 5 | 2 |
| **total** | **60,509** | **99,601** | |

Reproduce: concatenate the fragment files and sum `gate`, `count`, distinct `path` per row (`git ls-tree --name-only origin/main script/conformance/quality-baseline-lcov-bound/ | xargs -I{} git show origin/main:{}`). Halstead has no baseline rows (the gate passes absolutely).

Main-push evidence at `f5ea0e32`: CI run 35447606308 completed success (49 jobs success, 1 skipped) — exact lanes and the Quality join both complete on merged main, which closes the #1087 class.

Full mutation: campaign run 35447662597 dispatched on `f5ea0e32` (`quality-mutation.yml`, `pilot_limit=0`) reached compiler analysis (182,119 candidates, 0 diagnostics) and a green baseline (4,757 tests, 0 failures, exit 0), then exited 1 in the reach phase on `apps/openomni/test/code-mode-e2e.test.ts` (12/14 tests failing: `IpcTimeoutError: request timeout: machine.run_code`, cells "still running"). Cause: reach probes named bare `process`, and `packages/codemode/src/kernel.ts` declares a local `const process = spawn(...)` in `start()`, so the probe called `ChildProcess.getBuiltinModule` and killed every interpreter start. Fixed by #1103 (`97ec5b07`, probes reach globals only through `globalThis`); run 35455021958 re-dispatched on `97ec5b07`. No surviving-mutant count exists yet: no campaign has reached the execution phase.

Disposition: #945's literal-zero definition of done is **not met** at this HEAD. The gates, receipts and campaign infrastructure are wired and fail-closed (#1082, #1088–#1102); the remaining work is reduction of the baseline above, which is measured work with no ambiguity, not tooling. No baseline row was lowered by exemption in this campaign.

## §H 2026-09-20 sweep (main `84704df2`, session 01a0bddf)

Read-only sweep of slop not already recorded above and not named by the W1–W5 kernel ladder (#930). Five lanes, 61 findings; lane reports and issue triage under `.omo/reports/slop-sweep-20260920/`. Rows close per merged PR; ✅ = closed by PR #1114 (`374de398`) / PR #1115.

## §I #1116 lean PR gate: quality-ratchet stack deletion (2026-09-20)

PR A of #1116 replaced the per-PR Quality ratchet with the lean gate and
deleted the ratchet stack in one PR:

- **Deleted jobs** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Quality Static (5 legs),
  Quality Exact (sharded), Quality Gates, Quality (fan-in), Script Coverage,
  plus the coverage-receipt begin/seal steps in the test lanes.
- **Deleted scripts/tests/baselines** (~55 files): `check-census*`,
  `check-coverage-ratchet`, `check-quality-coverage`, `check-quality-metrics`,
  `quality-measure`, `quality-ci-{bound,coverage,exact,legs,metrics,shard}`,
  `quality-coverage-record`, `quality-coverage/`, `quality-metrics/` (except
  `input.ts`), `quality-proof`, `quality-schema`, `report-source-metrics`,
  `census-fixture`, their tests, `conformance/coverage-baseline.json`,
  `conformance/quality-baseline-lcov-bound*` and
  `conformance/quality-python-coverage.ini`.
- **Kept**: the scheduled mutation workflow (`quality-mutation.yml`,
  `run-quality-mutations*.ts`, `quality-mutation-*`, `quality-native-mutation`,
  `check-quality-python`) and its minimal import closure
  (`quality-{inventory,plan,source,json,ci-input,ci-receipt,native-lcov,native-process}`,
  `check-types-census`, `census-program`, `quality-metrics/input.ts`).
- **Added**: `complexity/noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity` (max 21) in
  `biome.json` with ~20 violations fixed by extraction (no suppressions; a
  scoped override exempts only the #1109-frozen `run-quality-mutations.ts` and
  `quality-mutation-compiler.ts`), and the PR-only `Patch Coverage` job over
  `script/check-patch-coverage.ts`.
- H17 above is partially closed by deletion: the duplicate parsers in
  `check-quality-coverage.ts` and `check-coverage-ratchet.ts` no longer exist;
  `quality-json.ts` and `quality-native-lcov.ts` are the single owners.
- The #945 absolute census receipt above keeps its historical measurement; the
  baseline fragments it describes are deleted at HEAD and any future closure
  claim requires a fresh scheduled-campaign measurement, not a ratchet state.
- Follow-up (#1049 sharded campaign, 2026-09-21): `quality-ratchet.ts` itself
  is deleted; the mutation wrapper/join referenced a
  `quality-baseline-mutation.json` that never existed and would have exited 2
  on every complete join. The campaign now records `current.json` only. The
  candidate universe drops test/fixture/benchmark files (61% of the 182,404
  candidates in run 35512259166) and suite-timeout hangs count as kills.

## §J 2026-09-29 quality-debt sweep (branch `quality/1237-sweep-20260929`, base `f7e36984`)

Fixes every still-applicable finding of Quality Audit run 36416999469 (issues
#1126..#1237, summary #1119) in one PR. Per-lane worklists and QA matrices were
produced under the ignored `.omo/quality-sweep/` directory and are not shipped.

- **Types**: written `any`/`unknown` stay 0 (`check-written-types`); owned
  transitive `unknown`/implicit-any sites in `script/` 13 -> 0, `packages/protocol`
  754 -> 93 (`JsonShapedValue` exported; remaining 93 are Zod `z.unknown`
  boundary parses documented in the protocol QA matrix). Prod clones in
  `apps/openomni` (`adoptWriterAuthority`, received-message action) now consume
  the agent exports `adoptSessionAuthority` and `receivedMessageAction`;
  `apps/openomni/src/composition/adopt-authority.ts` deleted. The agent
  `ForeignFailure` class is a re-export of the ledger one (was a duplicate).
- **Clones**: test clones in agent 48 -> 0, openomni 10 -> 0; `script/` 0
  (`expectExitViolation`/`captureConsole` in `capture-output.test-helper.ts`;
  `generate-models-snapshot.ts` extends the llm `CatalogModel`). jscpd reports
  0 duplicates in both the production and the test scope.
- **CRAP**: the six `script/check-import-cycles.ts` functions with no LCOV
  reach are now covered by `script/check-import-cycles.test.ts` (lane
  `scripts-contracts`); `main()`, `buildGraph()` and `selfTest()` are exported
  for that. CRAP findings 6 -> 0.
- **Complexity**: `noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity` findings in the audit's
  `script/`, `agent`, `channels`, `ledger` and `protocol` files resolved by
  extraction; no suppressions added.
- **Coverage**: lane LCOV now feeds the measure (12 workspace lanes plus the
  three serial script lanes). The remaining uncovered lines are CLI
  `main()`/violation-print paths in `script/` (~260 lines across 14 files) and
  the race-guard/pagination tails listed in the agent QA matrix.
- **Behavior changes** (intended, reviewed): `buildInventory` in
  `script/quality-inventory.ts` skips git-tracked paths absent from the working
  tree; `packages/policy` `pin()` keeps folding `PolicyCompileError` into the
  `failedSnapshot` (deny verdict with `error` code) rather than throwing; the
  `scripts-tooling-2` lane now lists `lint-side-effects.test.ts`.
- **Test hygiene**: deleted `packages/machines/test/helpers/socket-path.test.ts`
  (a 14-line clone of `apps/openomni/test/helpers/socket-path.test.ts`; the
  machines helper stays exercised by `attach`, `fs-wire` and `native-lifecycle`
  tests) and the ui composer
  keyboard/edit DOM test that only passed when `packages/ui` ran before
  `apps/desktop` in the same `bun test` process (React's event plugins bind to
  the first registered document; the composer's key/edit logic remains covered
  by `composer.test.tsx` and `composer-dom.fixture.tsx`). The pre-existing
  `967-U1` cleanup-oracle child-process echo is unchanged.
- **Issues whose file no longer exists** at HEAD (deleted by W5.2/W5.3) close
  as obsolete: #1140, #1202, #1205, #1230.
- Measured totals (`quality-audit --dry-run` with local LCOV): see the
  "Honest audit deltas" table in `docs/implementation-status.md`.

| Ten packages for five owners: ipc and codemode duplicated the machines wire band, policy/ledger/llm were agent-only dependencies, and the channel-facing stores sat a package away from their one consumer | #1246 | ✅ on `epic1260/1246-packages-10-5`: five packages remain (`protocol`, `agent`, `machines`, `channels`, `ui`) plus two apps — ipc+codemode folded into `packages/machines/src/{ipc,codemode}/`, policy/ledger/llm folded into `packages/agent/src/{kernel/gate,store,model}/`, channel-facing stores moved to `packages/channels/src/store/`; `MachinesFailure`/`AgentFailure` are the surviving carriers; `script/topology.ts` + `check-deps.ts` S8 bands (judgment `src/router/+src/authn/`, store `src/store/`) gate the two channels→agent allowances; `ls packages` = 5, the five retired package names, the ORM name, and the gate-hook token grep to zero across packages/apps/script/docs.

## §L #1259 sub-PRs

One row per #1259 sub-PR; each row accounts for every band item by idx with its disposition and verification.

| Band | Items | Disposition and verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| b3: machines + codemode (+ipc) | 74-78, 105-109 | 74 gone (resolved by #1262 `a4478b0e`); 77 gone (resolved by #1267 `d34218c6`); 78 gone (resolved by #1262 `a4478b0e`). 75 rewritten: `requireOpen()` folded into `tenantCell` and the duplicated `Effect.try` open-check in `peek`/`stop` collapsed to `try: () => tenantCell(cellId, tenant)` (`rg -n 'try: \(\) => tenantCell' packages/codemode/src/index.ts` -> 2 hits; `git log -1 --oneline -- packages/codemode/src/index.ts`). 76 renamed: unexported `interface Options` -> `CodemodeOptions` (`rg -n 'interface CodemodeOptions' packages/codemode/src/index.ts` -> the declaration; no barrel export touched). 105 deleted: `RootWalk` alias removed, `openRoot` returns the one-line `Root` (`rg -n 'RootWalk' packages/machines/src/fs.ts` -> no output; `git log -1 --oneline -- packages/machines/src/fs.ts`). 106 kept (reverted in r2): boundary parse owns the untyped thrown value; the written-types gate forbids the plain-function `unknown` signature and every caller is an `Effect.try` catch slot (`bun run script/check-written-types.ts` -> OK). 107 kept (reverted in r2): same rationale -- `machinesFallback`/`decodeMachineFailure`/`decodeIpcFailure` keep the zod boundary parse exactly as on origin/main. 108 deferred: owned by PR #1293 -- renaming the test-only `CodeRunner` requires editing `packages/codemode/test/codemode/helpers/native.ts`, which #1293 owns. 109 kept (zero diff): the complained shape no longer exists on main `ab62ca98` -- `connection(id)` returns the `Attachment` directly (fields `key`/`rawId`), no `id`-named return field remains. |
| b4 channels (drivers + router + authn + support), branch `epic1260/1259-b4-channels`, commit `c1420c6e` | 50-73 | **Fixed** — 53 delete: telegram `handleMessage` no longer re-checks `!text`/`!message.from` (normalizer owns the refusal; `rg -n 'if \(!text\) return' packages/channels/src/provider/telegram/surface.ts` → no output). 54 delete: discord handoff closure no longer re-checks `message.author.bot \|\| !message.content` (`rg -n 'author.bot \|\|' packages/channels/src/provider/discord/surface.ts` → no output). 55 rewrite: telegram/discord/slack handler casts (the three sites the item names) replaced by `requireHandler(this.handler, <id>)(inbound)` (`rg -n 'as Channel.MessageHandler' packages/channels/src/provider` → only `github/surface.ts:297`, which the item text does not name and which stays with its driver). 56 rewrite: `contract.ts` doc comment no longer cites the deleted `DeliveringSurface` (`rg -n DeliveringSurface packages/channels/src` → no output). 57 move: `verifyGitHubSignature` moved `src/provider/github/webhook.ts` → `src/authn/github-signature.ts` beside its only consumer `src/authn/github.ts`; not barrel-exported (`rg -n verifyGitHubSignature packages/channels/src` → declaration in `authn/github-signature.ts:3` + import in `authn/github.ts:4`). 59 rewrite: `void this.poller.start();` annotates the deliberately floating poll loop (`rg -n 'void this.poller.start' …/telegram/surface.ts` → `:85`). 73 delete: second file-level duplicate `beforeEach` in `test/router/messaging/send.test.ts` removed (`rg -c 'beforeEach\(' …/send.test.ts` → 1). All: `git log -1 --oneline -- <path>` → `c1420c6e`. **Kept (zero diff)** — 50: `fetch-retry.ts` already runs on `Effect.sleep`/`Effect.retry`; no exported `sleep` remains (`rg -n 'export function sleep' packages/channels/src` → no output). 52: `Dedupe` already takes an injected `now: () => number`; no ambient `Date.now` (`rg -n 'Date.now\(' packages/channels/src` → no output). 60: `retry_after ?? 5` is an acceptable published pacing default. 61: three per-driver `api()` helpers share shape but differ per platform; unifying would be a new abstraction. 62: `fetchGatewayUrl` bare `fetch` is the socket shell's reconnect seam; pacing it changes reconnect behavior. 63: accept — authn stays Promise-shaped until the authn-to-Effect migration. 64: keep — the synthesized two-rule policy is part of the recorded `PolicyDecision`; a direct construction changes observable decision facts. 65: `matchBlacklist` already requires `now: number` with no default. 66: `recordRouteDecided` already timestamps with the injected `at` from the decision's clock. 67: `request/native.ts` binding mismatches already fail with typed `ChannelsFailure`. 70: keep — the `attempts` Promise map is the documented physical-send custody seam (comment at `deliver.ts:22`). 72: accept — the prg-coverage double-cast reaches driver internals; a test seam would widen the API. **Gone (no code)** — 51/68: `reconnect-backoff.ts` deleted, resolved by #1263 `c1d5ebd2`/#1267 `d34218c6` (`rg -n 'Math.random\(' packages/channels/src` → no output). 58: real-interval heartbeat pins resolved by #1267 `d34218c6`. 69/71: dedupe `Date.now` + test monkeypatch resolved by #1263 `c1d5ebd2`. **Deferred** — none. |
| b1 protocol (core + gateway tests) | 141–165 | Fixed: 141 deleted `Tool.Events.PermissionDenied` (zero publishers, zero subscribers) and its test (`rg -n 'PermissionDenied' packages apps script` → 0); 142 deleted `Operational.envelope` (one-line spread wrapper, zero consumers) and its test (`rg -n 'Operational\.envelope' packages apps` → 0); 143 deleted `NamedError.Unknown` and its test block (`rg -n 'NamedError\.Unknown' packages/protocol` → 0); 144 rewrote the stale #500 C3 ownership comment to cite the real in-package NamedError consumers (`rg -n 'AdoptError' packages/protocol` → 0); 146 dropped the redundant `.nonnegative()` on `timeCreated` (`rg -n 'EpochMs\.nonnegative' packages/protocol` → 0); 148 rewrote the `MetaSchemaImpl` doc comment that cited the nonexistent `Channel.InboundMessage.raw` (`rg -n 'InboundMessage\.raw' packages/protocol` → 0); 152 replaced six `z.ZodIssueCode.custom` with the zod-4 `code: "custom"` string in `policy/resource.ts` (`rg -n 'ZodIssueCode' packages/protocol` → 0); 156 rewrote the `json.ts` header that falsely claimed "Not exported from the package barrel" (grep → 0); 158 replaced the stray Hangul word in the `gateway/schema.ts` active-egress comment with "escalation" (`rg -n '봉수' packages/protocol` → 0); 161 replaced the hand-rolled parse/catch patterns with `.toThrow()` in `channel-grant.test.ts`, `blacklist.test.ts`, `llm-event.test.ts` (the fourth site was in the deleted `policy-event-shapes.test.ts`; `rg -n 'failed = true\|completedParseFails' packages/protocol` → 0); 162 removed `const it = test;` from `policy.test.ts` and `policy/decision-effect.test.ts` (grep → 0); 164 reworded the two "envelope" comments in `gateway/message.ts` to "Driver-reported facts" / "observation context" (`rg -n envelope …/message.ts` → 0); 160 replaced the author's personal path in `test/channel-surface-key.test.ts` and the `SurfaceKey` doc example with `/srv/workspaces/example` (`rg -n 'Users/ino' packages/protocol` → 0; the `packages/agent/test/store/surface-key.test.ts` copy belongs to band 2). Kept (zero diff): 149 the `.catchall(z.unknown())` escape hatches are the documented deferred boundary catchall — authorization keys are already typed fields; 153 `sessionID`/`messageID`/`callID` rename would widen through the barrel-exported `Message` schema into every consumer — keep per rule 1; 165 `RuleTableA`/`RuleTableB` cosmetic only. Deferred: 154 `Channel.Config` deletion needs `packages/channels/src/provider/*/surface.ts` + `provider/contract.ts` (owned by the channels band); 145 `Inbox.Port` (zero implementers, zero importers) still lives in `ledger/l0.ts`, owned by #1258 (PR #1294) — delete there. Gone (no code): 147, 150, 155, 157, 163 symbol/path gone (157: `Actor` metadata is already `PlainValueSchema`-typed); 151 resolved by #1289; 159 resolved by #1266. `bun test packages/protocol` 524 pass / 0 fail; patch coverage all changed executable lines covered. |
| b6 ui + script gates (`epic1260/1259-b6-ui-script-gates`) | 166-181 | Fixed 171: `script/quality-native-process.ts` excerpt-size comment now names `ERROR_LIMIT` (20 kB), not "16 KB" — `rg -n 'ERROR_LIMIT bytes' script/quality-native-process.ts` → the line-11 declaration comment; `git log -1 --oneline -- script/quality-native-process.ts` → `41ba2a80`. Gone: none — the mechanical triage labelled 167/173/174/179 as resolved by #1241/#1037/#1015/#989, and review r1 disproved each against origin/main `79649f3c`: 167 `script/conformance/lint-tools-baseline.json` still lists ten `vocab.unmappedNamespaces` entries (#1241 only emptied `naming.grandfathered`); 173 `StatusDot` (`packages/ui/src/primitives/state.tsx:15`) and `StatusGlyph` (`packages/ui/src/status-glyph.tsx:22`) still coexist (#1037 only moved `StatusDot`); 174 the four chromatic tokens are still at `packages/ui/src/styles.css:147-150`, pinned by `packages/ui/test/status-glyph.test.tsx:72` (#1015 introduced them); 179 was a clean-audit record whose ratchet test `apps/desktop/test/ui-barrel.test.ts` exists. Keep: 167 the unmapped-namespace list is explicit #465 P3 debt, not a baseline leak; 173 the two status families are an intentional two-scope split (phase presentation in desktop, generic tone in ui); 174 the status tokens are `StatusGlyph`-only by design and test-pinned; 179 nothing to resolve; 166 `RUNNER_OWNERS` tracks designated runner helpers, a set not derivable mechanically; 168 the request-authority census is the post-#1197 resurrection guard; 169 the retired-spelling indirection is the test's own grep shield, explained in its comment; 170 the `"none"` input/output sentinel is a commented deliberate rendering choice; 172 `Provenance` + rule codes form one cohesive, commented Effect-boundary domain; 175 renaming `sessionId` → `transcriptKey` would change the public `Timeline` barrel export (`packages/ui/src/index.ts:26`), so rule 1 says keep; 176 the composer-dom child spawn waits on the real exit code, not timing; 177 `relativeTime` is intentionally compact-form, not locale-aware; 178 `omitPresentationProps` is plain single-purpose prop splitting; 180 is a recorded clean-audit result with nothing to change; 181 stray blank lines are too trivial to spend a diff on. |
| b5 openomni composition + tools + delegation cli (`epic1260/1259-b5-openomni`) | 110-136 | **Fixed** — 115 delete: retired `OPENOMNI_DB_PATH` env var removed from `test/config.test.ts` ENV_KEYS and `test/cli-entry.test.ts` (no reader under src/; `rg -rn 'OPENOMNI_DB_PATH' apps packages` → no output). 116 rewrite: the five boot-composition `console.error` incident sites in `src/index.ts` (watch send failed, late hook dropped, process wake failed, deadline arm failed, boot rescan failed) now publish `Operational.Events.Error` through the composition's `ObservationSink` via a boot-local `incident` closure; the shutdown-handler site stays on stderr because the sink's scope may already be closed at that point (`rg -n 'console.error' apps/openomni/src/index.ts` → only `:1294` the shutdown handler; `git log -1 --oneline -- apps/openomni/src/index.ts` → `4db917a9`). 119 rename: `test/index-coverage.test.ts` → `test/app-surface.test.ts` (pure rename; its console-spy assertions now subscribe to the Bus `Operational.Events.Error` event). 124 rewrite: `createMonitorTool(ports?: MonitorPorts)` → explicit `ports: MonitorPorts \| undefined` like every sibling factory; call sites pass `undefined` (`rg -n 'ports: MonitorPorts \| undefined' apps/openomni/src/bundles/monitor/index.ts` → `:81`). 129 rewrite: `find.ts` `relativeTo` refuses a walked path outside the search root instead of silently matching the glob against an absolute path (`rg -n 'escaped search root' apps/openomni/src/tools/find.ts` → `:56`). 131 rewrite: `eval.ts` `signal` params narrowed from `AbortSignal \| undefined` to the protocol context's non-optional `AbortSignal` (`rg -n 'AbortSignal \| undefined' apps/openomni/src/tools/eval.ts` → no output). **Kept (zero diff)** — 117 the reply-grant `instanceTtlMs`/`maxLiveInstances` literals are composition-root wiring; a named constant adds a seam nothing else reads. 120 already resolved in place: `completion.ts` mints identity from injected `sources.now()`/`sources.id()`, not ambient `Date.now()`. 121 the gateway `session_read` bare catch is acceptable ws-boundary shape (file is band-7-owned anyway). 123 `follow()`'s hand-rolled child lifecycle is CLI-local process plumbing; rewriting it onto Effect changes no behavior and risks the kill-escalation timing (file is band-7-owned anyway). 125 keep-but-rename judged keep: attributing `ToolRefused("locus"\|"walk"\|"text")` to a real catalog tool requires threading the calling tool's name through the shared locus/filesystem helpers — API widening, so rule 1 says keep. 126 the `/machines` virtual-root guard is a two-line refusal of a retired surface; deleting it trades a cheap guard for silent acceptance. 128 the `spent` budget map is bounded by generation turnover as the inventory itself notes. 130 the find/grep limit-admission duplication is two small sites; unifying is a new abstraction. 132 `state.value ?? state.output.stdout` is the cell contract (expression result over prints). 134 the hand-rolled narrowings are local and typed; a zod schema here is a new abstraction. 135 `endpoint?.actorId ?? endpointId` is the documented CAS-key fold for absent endpoints. 136 triage false-gone (the hand-rolled regex escape survives at `grep.ts:30`; the triage grepped for the replacement symbol): kept because `RegExp.escape` exists in Bun's runtime but the repo compiles with `lib: ES2021` in the root `tsconfig.base.json`, which this band does not own. **Gone (no code)** — 110 resolved by #1245 `c1d5ebd2` (`desiredChannels` takes an injected `KekResolution`; `rg -n 'process.env' apps/openomni/src/provisioning` → no output); 111 resolved by #1266 `a5ee6c4d`; 112/113 `composition/monitor-ports.ts` deleted by #1285 `77e1375b`; 114 resolved by #1289 `5362b3bd`; 122 resolved by #1281 `765986097` (`cli/machine.ts` rewritten with a correctly indented `Effect.gen` body); 127 resolved by #1284 `a66dc3a7`. **Deferred** — 118 (`src/config.ts` bare-Error vs `ConfigurationError`) and 133 (`src/tools/provision.ts` first-underscore `replace`): band 7 owns both files. `bun test apps/openomni` 727 pass / 0 fail; patch coverage: all changed executable lines covered. |

`rg -n writable packages/agent/src/core/store/fence.ts` → 0); knock-on (review r1 M-1): the deletion left `StorageUnavailable.capability: "storage"` producer-less, so the member is dropped and its two fixture constructors pin `"sessions"` — one of them, `script/effect-error-contract.test.ts:59`, sits outside this band's `packages/agent/** + docs` ownership and is edited as a forced one-token boundary exception (`rg -n 'capability: "storage"' script packages apps` → 0). 88 flatten: vestigial `for (const backend of ["SQLite"])` loop removed from `policy-generation.test.ts` (grep → 0). 90 rewrite: `model/errors.ts` module-load zod field schemas → plain types; no parse existed (`rg -c 'z\.' …/model/errors.ts` → 0). 104 delete: source-text regex ratchets removed from `model/retry/retry.test.ts` and `model/provider/registry.test.ts`; runtime `Object.hasOwn` surface checks stay (`rg -c 'not.toMatch' <both>` → 0). 137+138 delete: `evaluatedRuleCount` and `bucket`/`publicBucket` removed from `PolicyEvaluation` (test-only consumers; `rg -n 'evaluatedRuleCount\|publicBucket' packages/agent/src` → 0). **Kept (zero diff)** — 3 documented render-preserving anchor degrade; 4 `Number.isFinite` clamp — refusing malformed config is a behavior change;

source.now()` falls back to the caller's required `MessageSource` clock, not ambient wall-clock (#1263). 208 gateway `toolPorts` takes the injected `ports.now` (gateway.ts:123 "#1245: required, no ambient Date/crypto"; #1263). 224 `StorageUnavailable.capability` lists exactly the four constructed values `sessions\|actions\|policies\|armed_alarms` (b2 PR #1300 dropped `storage`, #1285 `77e1375b0` renamed the alarm plane; fence.ts constructs all four). 225 `SessionCommitError` is a `Data.TaggedError` in `core/failure.ts` (#1262 `a4478b0ea`). 227 the four bare tool-wave throws are typed `AgentInvariantViolation` or an `Effect.die` defect (#1262; `rg -n 'throw new Error' packages/agent/src` → no output). 228 `ReplyGrantProjectionError` is declared in `store/errors.ts`, the package's errors owner (#1277 `6a9063d75`). 229 `ForeignFailure` deleted treewide (#1262 `a4478b0ea`). 233 `withStoreTimestamps` requires explicit `now: number` (#1263). 234 the C1 admission test synchronizes on receipts — no `Effect.sleep(40)`/`performance.now()` span remains (#1266 `a5ee6c4de`; grep of `packages/agent/test/session/entity-admission.test.ts` → no output). 240 `backoffDelayMs(attempt, random)` takes injected randomness (#1263; `rg -n 'Math.random' packages/agent/src` → no output). 260 the run-entry bare throw became an `Effect.die` defect (`core/turn.ts:781`; #1262) — retyping the die payload would edit an uncovered defect branch (coverage rule). 261 `successfulOutcome` throws typed `AgentInvariantViolation` (`core/turn.ts:985`; #1262). **Kept (zero diff) 24** — 37 `processId` is an optional field of the barrel-exported runtime config; requiring it widens the public contract (rule 1), and `?? process.pid` is the writer-identity default at the two runtime edges. 92/93/205 the assistant-message `agent`/`parentID`/`path` values are emitted protocol fields: threading the real agent name, refusing an empty history, or injecting cwd changes observable messages and widens `RunInput` (rule 1; no covering test for a new refusal). 96 the four digests hash different input shapes (JSON auth, canonical header string, tagged api-key string) and `Auth.reference`'s fingerprint is surfaced in run outcomes — one `fingerprint(value)` would change cache keys and surfaced fingerprints. 139 the `"A"`/`"B"` literals are protocol's `Gateway.RuleTableA/B` discriminator (band 1 kept them, item 165); `matchesMessage` already dispatches to the semantic `matchesExternal`/`matchesSession`. 192 `maxRetries: 0` deliberately disables SDK retries; the package retry policy owns them. 197 `action-hash.ts`'s positional-JSON sha256 is era-pinned on persisted bytes beside protocol `canonicalDigest` (triage keep). 198 `clonePlainValue`'s JSON round-trip is load-bearing (non-finite normalization); rename-only churn. 206 the catalog cache-write `Effect.catch(() => …)` is a deliberate best-effort cache; an operational event is new behavior. 207 `adaptStream` is the correct adapter at the AI SDK AsyncIterable boundary. 209 `gateway.ts` is an approved runner edge and the synchronous ledger transaction requires `Effect.runSync` (gateway.ts:568). 214 composition-root env parsing stays hand-rolled; a `Config`/zod layer is a new abstraction. 217 the second `ManagedRuntime` Scope carrier is the documented v4 dispose/interrupt workaround at an approved edge (cli/main.ts:172). 218/258 the SIGTERM→SIGKILL `setTimeout` escalation is a real process-management boundary (cli/main.ts:150); an Effect rewrite risks the escalation timing and its kill path is uncovered (coverage rule; b5 kept the same file as 123). 226 `ExecutorContextError` is one declaration with a typed `code`, constructed once (decide.ts:376); tests pin the plain-Error `name`/`code` shape. 235 `waitUntil` is a bounded poll-for-real-condition helper (triage keep). 241/242 the `finishBody`/`completionFailure` typed-exit folds survive in `gate/decide.ts` with `ForeignFailure` gone (triage keep). 246 `probeHealth`'s plain `fetch` try/catch is a legitimate CLI-edge probe (cli/main.ts:126). 248 the ws `send()` generic `session_read_failed` frame is acceptable boundary shape (gateway.ts:368; b5 kept the same site as 121). 250 moving the test-only `runLedgerSync` into `src/testing` would ship a test runner in production source and add an export (rule 1; the same reason 7a kept 249/251/254). 264 moving `PROVISION_POLICY_ROWS` into packages/agent (ex-policy) creates a new cross-package export (rule 1: keep). **Deferred** — none. `bun test packages/agent` 1750 pass / 0 fail; `bun test apps/openomni` 727 pass / 0 fail; patch coverage: all changed executable lines covered; net LOC −19 (+45/−64 vs base `bfa9f5e14`). |

| 3: #1304 action plugin source | `stab/3-action-plugin-source` | The `action` capability moved from `apps/openomni/src/manifest.ts` into `packages/agent/src/plugins/action/index.ts` (`actionCapability()` + `ActionSeam`, exported via the `Bundle` namespace); the app-owned `ActionCapabilitySeam` deleted and `delegation-policy` re-pointed at `Bundle.ActionSeam`. `rg -c 'ActionCapabilitySeam' -g '*.ts' packages apps` → no output; `rg -c 'action plugin \(scaffold\)' packages/agent/src/plugins/action` → no output; `bun test packages/agent/test/action-plugin.test.ts` → 2 pass; `apps/openomni/test/hooks-json.test.ts` off-cascade unchanged (action, hook, hooks-json, delegation-policy all `because: "action"`); `check-deps`/`check-dead-exports` exit 0. |
| 6: #1317 channel-facing store split | `stab/6-store-channel-split` | Move: the channel-facing SQLite plane left the agent catalog — `packages/channels/src/store/sqlite/schema.ts` owns the DDL verbatim (`person`/`secret`/`channel_instance` ride with the provisioning adapter), `openChannelStore(db, now)` binds the seven `git mv`-ed adapters plus the handle-bound write transaction, the catalog exposes only its raw `database` handle and the app attaches the channels store once per boot (`AppLedgerPlane.channel`; gateway `channelStoreSource` reads `plane.channel.*`). Durable bytes unchanged: `packages/channels/test/store/sqlite/schema-roundtrip.test.ts` snapshots `sqlite_master` name+sql and one row per table across the agent opener and `openChannelStore` on the same file. Greps at 0: `rg -c 'createSqlite(ActorRegistry\|Blacklist\|ChannelGrant\|EgressBudget\|ReplyGrant\|SurfaceKey)Adapter' packages/agent apps` (22 → 0); `rg -c 'plane\.catalog\.(actorRegistry\|blacklist\|channelGrant\|replyGrant\|egressBudget\|surfaceKey)' apps` (6 → 0); `rg -c 'agent/test/store/helpers/storage' packages/channels` (4 → 0); channel-facing `CREATE TABLE` under packages/agent (7 → 0). check-deps channels→agent named-import pin shrank by `createSurfaceKeyStore`. `bun test packages/channels/test` 679 pass / 0 fail; `bun test packages/agent/test` 1722 pass / 0 fail; `bun test apps/openomni/test` 727 pass / 0 fail. |
| 7: #1306 capability off boot tests | `stab/7-capability-off-boot-tests` | `apps/openomni/test/capability-off-boot.test.ts` boots the full app once per capability in `off` (8 pass: 5 matrix rows + mixed `["monitor","hook"]` + unknown-name + alarm golden), each row pinning the `session.configure{operation: "compose"}` `disabled` cascade by `toEqual`, the removed surface and the `unknown_kind` refusal with zero new facts; `config.bundlesOff` → `off` (one key, bundles and capabilities; `rg -c 'bundlesOff' -g '*.ts' packages apps` 10→no output); `resident.ts` journals the cascade at first adoption (genesis unstamped only when `disabled` is nonempty) and a composed-off tool capability offers zero model tool faces; `createWatchVerb` rides the `Bundle` barrel (`rg -c 'src/plugins/' -g '*.ts' apps/openomni/test` 1→no output). `bun test apps/openomni` 737/738 + flake re-runs green; `bun test packages/agent` 1744 pass / 0 fail. |
| 5: #1312 delete unused helpers and silent fallbacks | `stab/5-delete-fallbacks-dead-helpers` | Band A: `JsonShapedValueSchema` is a runtime boundary (`acceptJsonShapedValue` gone) and `EvaluationRequest` carries JSON-shaped records; one `isContained` predicate for host and daemon; PTY timeout removes its FIFO entry (TestClock test, late reply dropped); `peekCode` without a runner → `kernel_not_available`; IPC dispatcher bound required and typed `IpcQueueFullError`; host `callTool` required → `host_tool_missing`; computer-use `spawn_failed`/`read_failed`/`probe_timeout`; Python cleanup failure lists → `browser_cleanup_failed`. Band B: telegram poller on `listenForAbort` (pre-aborted poll = zero requests); invalid `OPENOMNI_WS_PORT` → `DesktopConfigError`, main refuses to boot; `TranscriptMarkdown` required-payload union, blank-element branches deleted. Band C: `replaceFileAtomically` + its test, eight single-file exports, `Inspect.forkAsideTransformer` deleted; `ModelCatalogError{cache|remote|cache_write}` replaces the `{}` cache fallback; `createResidentGateway` ports required. Each deleted name greps to zero in `packages/*/src apps/*/src`; every replaced fallback has a test asserting the typed outcome; 92 files, +1267/-696. |
| 4: #1318 coverage/type/mutation gate escapes + timing tests | `stab/4-gate-escape-closure` | patch-coverage `GATED` covers `script/quality-metrics/`+`script/quality-mutation/` (fixtures excluded; planted nested uncovered line exits 1), written-type gate scans `packages/*/test/**`, `apps/*/test/**`, `script/*.test.ts` with 0 remaining test-source `unknown`/`any` (planted test `unknown` exits 1), incomplete mutation shard/join exit 1 (errors exit 2) and all `quality-mutation.yml` uploads `if-no-files-found: error`; `toBeLessThan(3500)` 0, `while (!settled\|!condition` 0, `new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve` 0 in packages/apps, `Date.now()` 0 in `cluster-crash-child.ts`, duplicate bus `name` test deleted; four script gates unchanged with invariant headers, `knip-baseline.json` `"grandfathered": []`. |
| 8: #1310 mailbox admission split | `stab/8-mailbox-admission-split` | Split: `core/mailbox.ts` deleted into `core/admission.ts`/`core/recovery.ts`/`core/request.ts` (one owner per job; `rg 'core/mailbox' packages apps` 0). Typed refusals: admission snapshot with no registered capability kinds → `missing_capability_kinds` (`BUILTIN_CAPABILITY_KINDS` 2 → 0); prompt with no recorded origin → turn fails typed `InboundAuthorityViolation("missing_origin")` (`origin === undefined` 1 → 0); reason unions in `core/failure.ts`/`core/admission.ts` + zod enum in `core/run.ts`, not protocol (recorded deviation). `stopEvidence` required on `ChatAgentConfig` and the runner input; `turn.ts` consults the port with no empty-evidence fallback (`stopEvidence\?` 3 → 0). `bun test packages/agent/test` 1740 pass / 0 fail. |
| 9: #1309 move executable product policy from core into app bundles behind seams | `stab/9-core-policy-to-bundles` | `ApprovalPolicySeam` + `ApprovalPolicy` data shape in `core/approval-policy.ts` (exported via `core/api.ts`); owner responder, 8-per-hour quota, 24h expiry and `BUDGET_DEFAULTS` deleted from core (`rg '\["owner"\]|count >= 8|3_600_000|86_400_000|BUDGET_DEFAULTS' packages/agent/src/core` → no output; `BUDGET_DEFAULTS` in packages+apps 7 → 0) and injected through required ports (`SessionRuntime`/`SessionEntityPorts`/`ExecutorOptions.approvalPolicy`, `ChatAgentConfig.defaultBudget`, `resolveAgentBudget` at loop entry); `apps/openomni/src/bundles/approval-policy` owns the shipped values, `appManifest` lists it and composing without it refuses `seam_missing` (send-message requires the seam). Tests: `packages/agent/test/approval-policy.test.ts` 4 pass; `apps/openomni/test/approval-policy.test.ts` 3 pass; `delegation-policy.test.ts` unchanged; request bytes unchanged. |
| 13: #1313 typed idempotency conflict + seam_missing deliver refusals | `stab/13-typed-admission-idempotency` | `DeliverRefused.code` grown to the exact six-literal set (`idempotency_conflict`, `seam_missing` added); replayed key with a differing payload refused `idempotency_conflict` by canonical action-hash comparison (`core/store/action-hash.ts`) before admission — zero rows appended, identical replay still `{seq, existed: true}` (production `existed: true` 1 → 1); `appendReceived` dedupe applies the same hash check; unbound `inputRegistrations` port refused `seam_missing`, `?? CORE_INPUT_REGISTRATIONS` fallback + const deleted (1 → 0, const 2 → 0); fixtures bind the port explicitly. `bun test packages/agent/test/deliver-idempotency.test.ts` 5 pass / 0 fail. |
| 10: #1308 composition-root dedupe | `stab/10-composition-root-dedupe` | Seal: `StartOptions`/`ResidentOptions` lost `toolDefinitions` (0 hits under `apps/openomni`; test tools ride a declared manifest bundle); `monitor` declared once by its bundle (`catalogDefinitions` = 11 factories, duplicate tool name = typed `duplicate` refusal, `send_message` exempt by ruling); `monitorSeedRows` and `emptyComposition` deleted (`composed` required, CLI passes config only); the process child rebuilds manifest+compose from `ProcessSessionRequest` (`hooksPath`/`off`) and drains via the session entity (`decideSessionAdmission` 0 in `process-entry.ts`); `composition-fixtures.ts`/`composition-drift.test.ts` deleted. |
