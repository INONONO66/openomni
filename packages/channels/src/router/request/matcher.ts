 * is the registry-resolved actor registered at that endpoint (registry-anchored,
 * not sender-claimed — the ActorRegistry lookup happens here). Every other expected responder replies from their OWN
 * endpoint, and their identity proof is the resolved-actor evidence alone.
 * Because every target carries an actor pin, request rows never accept
 * bearer-only replies. A delivery endpoint that no longer resolves
 * (`deliveryActorId === undefined` while the endpoint pin is present) fails
 * closed: no candidates, rather than a weaker unpinned target set.
