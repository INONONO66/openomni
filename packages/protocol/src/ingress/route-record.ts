 * internal product path — may not import each other
 * (openomni↛channels = 0/0), so the PURE parts of their once byte-identical
 * `route.decided` recorders are hoisted here: both arms import these and do
 * their OWN durable record (each through its own scoped `DecisionFacts.port()`
 * and its own package-local typed error). Precedent: the #707 slice-1 wait
 * physical request matcher in channels.
