/**
 * Every rendered piece of this surface has a stable, visible ADDRESS.
 *
 * Every exported component stamps `data-ui` on its root element, and the value
 * comes from HERE and from nowhere else, so a rename propagates in one edit and
 * a review can name an element (`ToolGroup.Summary`) instead of describing it.
 *
 * Dotted names are PARTS, not variants: `Turn.Prompt` is the prompt region
 * inside a `Turn`, whose own name is in the DOM above it.
 *
 * Ordered by where the eye lands: the frame, then the navigator's parts, then
 * the transcript top-down, then the input zone, then the primitives that appear
 * inside all of them.
