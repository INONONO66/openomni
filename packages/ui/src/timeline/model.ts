/**
 * The transcript's INPUT SHAPE — what a ledger column has to be handed in order
 * to be laid out, and nothing else.
 *
 * This is the boundary that lets the transcript live in the design system at
 * all. `apps/desktop`'s mock declares a `TimelineNode` carrying a
 * `PolicyVerdict`, per-call `phases`, and a `RunState` — kernel vocabulary, and
 * correctly the app's. The transcript reads NONE of it. What layout actually
 * needs is: who spoke, in what order, what a tool call was called, how it
 * ended, and where the ledger's own boundaries are.
 *
 * No state here is a product state. `ToolStatus` is a CALL OUTCOME, and the
 * only structural question the layout asks of it is "may this row be folded
 * away" — never "what is this run doing". A product that called its states
 * `green`/`amber`/`red` would map onto this unchanged.

 * transcript's calls succeeded, and a field repeated on forty rows to say
 * "nothing went wrong" is noise in the data as much as on screen.
 *
 * The other four are exactly the states that print a WORD on the row and that a
 * collapse may never hide. That is one rule expressed once — `LOUD` below is
 * derived from this union, so a new loud state cannot be added to the type
 * without the never-hide rule picking it up.
