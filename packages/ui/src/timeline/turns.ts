/**
 * Segmenting the flat ledger into the parts the column actually draws.
 *
 * The one structural claim this file makes is CHRONOLOGY: tool calls are shown
 * where they happened, not gathered into a per-turn appendix. If the agent read
 * a file, said something, then ran a test, the column shows read → text → test.
 * Sorting all the work to the top of the turn would be tidier and would be a
 * lie about the order the agent thought in, which is the one thing a transcript
 * exists to preserve.
 *
 * That is why a prose part SPLITS a tool group. Adjacency in the data is the
 * only thing that makes two calls one block; a sentence between them means they
 * were two separate pieces of work and they are drawn that way.
